## Drawback Of API
  - Limited global coverage due to its free nature, not supporting all locations worldwide.
  - Ambiguous or polyonymous location names may cause issues.
  
  - **Solution** : Attempting various name iterations or utilizing updated naming conventions.

## Status Of TempStation
- For now, Tempstation is exclusively available for desktop viewing; it hasn't been optimized for mobile devices.
- However, plans are underway to make it mobile-responsive in the near future.
- The format for sunrise and sunset times adheres to IST (Indian Standard Time).
